<h1 class="gap">0x00. Fix my code</h1>

<h2>Background Context</h2>

<p><code>Fix my code</code> is a new type of project, where we&rsquo;ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!</p>

<p>Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.</p>

<p>Please download the repository <a href="/rltoken/V1o_qyMWRS-uCTQX1t5VrQ" title="0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge" target="_blank">0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge</a> and use it as initial files for all solutions.</p>

<p>You should not recode everything, just fix it!</p>

<p><strong>This project is NOT mandatory</strong> at all. It is 100% optional. Doing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your score won&rsquo;t get hurt if you don&rsquo;t do it, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might go down. Have fun!</p>
